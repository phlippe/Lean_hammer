	abstract="This paper describes a translation of the complex calculus of dependent type theory into the relatively simpler higher order logic originally introduced by Church. In particular, it shows how type dependency as found in Martin-L{\"o}f's Intuitionistic Type Theory can be simulated in the formulation of higher order logic mechanized by the HOL theoremproving system. The outcome is a theorem prover for dependent type theory, built on top of HOL, that allows natural and flexible use of set-theoretic notions. A bit more technically, the language of the resulting theorem-prover is the internal language of a (boolean) topos (as formulated by Phoa).",

	abstract="Decades of work have gone into developing efficient proof calculi, data structures, algorithms, and heuristics for first-order automatic theorem proving. Higher-order provers lag behind in terms of efficiency. Instead of developing a new higher-order prover from the ground up, we propose to start with the state-of-the-art superposition-based prover E and gradually enrich it with higher-order features. We explain how to extend the prover's data structures, algorithms, and heuristics to {\$}{\$}{\backslash}lambda {\$}{\$}-free higher-order logic, a formalism that supports partial application and applied variables. Our extension outperforms the traditional encoding and appears promising as a stepping stone towards full higher-order logic.",
